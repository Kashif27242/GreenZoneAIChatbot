Hurt can bring up a lot of different emotions, like sadness, anger, confusion, or even a sense of betrayal.\n\nWould you like to tell me more about what happened? Talking about it can sometimes help to process the experience and begin to heal. If you're not ready to talk about the specifics, that's perfectly okay too. We can also explore general strategies for coping with hurt feelings.\n\nJust let me know what feels most comfortable for you right now. I'm here to listen and support you.\n"
